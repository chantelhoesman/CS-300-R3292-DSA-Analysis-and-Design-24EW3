1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving was related to sorting data in data structures. 
We reviewed hastables, vectors, and binary trees. We sorted data in many ways.
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem firstly by reviewing how each data structure works.
Then from there I made a plan on how I would code the data structure.
Lastly, I coded the data structure and reviewed with the tutors for understanding on best practices. 
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When I hit a roadblock, I would always search on google first. Then reach out to the tutors if the answers were not clear.
I would also reach out to the tutors for better explanations on the resolutions. I found that just because you can make
something work does not mean you should just gloss over it you should try to understand why it works.
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
We learned techniques and ways of sorting data. As to changes in my approach it remains the same as I attempt to
thoroughly review issues prior to moving on. After coding I always go back to review what I have done or what can be better.
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Prior to this course I did not have a grasp of C++. This course forces you to learn it and learn it fast. While I understand
we should already have the basics from other courses I still have trouble converting pseudocode to the new code we are supposed to be learning.
Working from pseudocode is the best way to make the files maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
